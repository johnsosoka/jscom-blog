Way back in October 2020, I accepted a position at a new employer with the understanding that I would relocate to Charlotte, 
North Carolina. For some time my wife and I had been itching for a "great american adventure" but we never made any concrete
plans.

I should note before continuing on that we moved in May. I am just playing catch-up here since I had lost interest in the
blog for a time.

We have two dogs and decided that driving across the country would be more comfortable for them and a more interesting 
adventure for us; I personally wanted to _feel_ the distance between Idaho and North Carolina.

We decided to use a moving pod to transport our items. The whole pod experience was great, and they are very 
cost-effective. We used a local moving crew to load the pod up after we packed up our items.

Believe it or not there is a baby grand piano hidden in the above image. We weren't sure which pod size to get, so we
landed on the largest available which seemed to be just a little too big. We had a few days between the pod shipping and
us leaving. We had the choice to live without our items either before we left or after we arrived in Charlotte and we
decided it would be best to arrive with our items in town. This means that we had a couple of nights with near zero 
furniture. We did have some furniture, which we gave away/donated leading up to our final night at the old place.

Above is nice shot of our car with some mountains behind. This was shot just outside of Salt Lake City, Utah.

The colonial pipeline was hacked during our drive to North Carolina. We did not notice the effects of it until we crossed 
into NC state lines. We were very worried that we would not be able to purchase gas and would wind up stranded before 
making it to our new home. I snapped the above photo at the first gas station we stopped at in NC state lines. Luckily,
we were able to fill up at another station just down the street.

Our moving pod was delayed, so despite our best efforts we still had several days with almost no furniture. Not a big
deal. Our pod driver did a really great job navigating the narrow roads in our neighborhood. At the time of this writing
 we have been in North Carolina for a couple of months. We are enjoying it so far, the greenery is astounding, the 
people are delightful and there is plenty to explore. 

Until next time,

John
