## Server
* 04/27/2022 - Realm is live. Contact for invite.
* ~~01/10/2022 - minecraft.johnsosoka.com is live!~~

## Downloads

Over the years I have either hosted and/or played on friend hosted minecraft realms & servers. Some worlds have been
lost while others have been backed up. On this page I will do my best to keep world-saves available for download; it
feels wrong to hoard the world backups and not share all the cool creations friends & friends of friends have come up
with.

### World Backups
