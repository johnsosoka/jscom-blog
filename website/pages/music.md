I have written a bit of music in my life. The bulk of it was developed solo, although I have been in several bands
over the years as well. Here I will make some of my work available for download--I am long overdue to get back into
the habit of composing. Most was written using Propellerhead's Reason and FL Studio.


# Through Times Eyes (EP) 2007
### About
At the time of writing this I was definitely going through a major [Moby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moby)  phase, 
many of the songs have samples woven in that were acquired from the library of congress--Very old recordings of people 
talking, performing or lecturing. [Download](https://fileshare.johnsosoka.com/music/the-concept/through-times-eyes-ep/Through-Times-Eyes-2007.zip).
