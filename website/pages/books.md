I consume books in _almost_ all of their forms--while I do own [a book printed in braille](/books/the-book-in-braille/) I 
never learned how to read it. 

**Audiobooks:** Generally I use audiobooks for simpler reading--fiction or casual non-fiction like
biographical books or some books on current events. I typically listen to audiobooks while on my daily walks.

**E-Reader:** I use a Kindle Oasis e-reader for casual & slightly more advanced books. I really enjoy the ability to 
quickly look up words & to be able to readily access my highlights from anywhere, thanks to the Goodreads integration.

**Physical/Paper:** I typically reserve paper/physical books for the most technical literature. If I expect that I will 
need to regularly refer back to previous material as I read then I'll use regular books. AThat being said, I do enjoy 
the feeling of a book in my hands and will use physical books for easier/more casual reading as well.


Here are some books that seemed worth mentioning. I try to keep my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45921293-john-sosoka)
profile up to date, but I don't always succeed.
