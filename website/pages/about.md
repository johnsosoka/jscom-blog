## Me:

I am John Sosoka, a Boise based software engineer. I am a backend developer and usually work 
with java & python day to day. Over the course of my career I have worked in a variety of roles in software development,
including software tester, release engineer, software engineer and tech lead.

When I'm not coding you can find me hiking the trails around Boise with my dogs, hanging out with my family, or 
working on projects around the house. 

I also really enjoy Pinball and have been playing quite a bit at the [Pinball Museum](https://idahopinballmuseum.com/)
in Garden City. I haven't [competed recently](https://www.ifpapinball.com/player.php?p=50104#past), but I'm hoping to
be in competitive shape this fall (2023).

I have been on GitHub for a while under a pseudonym, but have recently created a more polished profile which you can 
[visit here](https://github.com/johnsosoka). This same GitHub profile will host code examples to accompany blog posts.

## Website:

This website is intended to serve as a base of operations for me. I enjoy running this website as somebody might enjoy 
keeping a garden, I like contributing to it and watching it grow but don't have any ambitious plans for it.

As I'm not a professional writer and this is a very low traffic site I might edit or update posts after they are 
published; But, a public record of all changes will be available in the GitHub repository, linked below.

View the source for this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnsosoka/jscom-blog). This includes the
Terraform to provision AWS infrastructure for johnsosoka.com as well.
