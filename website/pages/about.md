## Me:

I am john sosoka, a software engineer currently working in financial tech. I am a backend developer and usually 
work with java & python day to day. I have worked as a release engineer in the past & continue to have an interest in 
dev/ops (running this site helps scratch some of that itch).

## Website:

This website is intended to serve as a base of operations for me. There is a blog which I'm hoping to contribute more to,
posts there will probably be some combination of technical projects & personal/family updates. 

### Home Office Setup:

Here is a pic of my home office setup. I am currently in a work from home configuration. Work setup is to the left and home setup is to the right.
