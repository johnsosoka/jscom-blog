## Life

My father, [John Sosoka Jr.](https://everloved.com/life-of/john-sosoka-ii/obituary/), who helped to foster an interest in technology, a love of learning, faith in humanity, and a sense of humor.
He was taken from us too soon, but his influence continues to shape many lives.

My loving wife, Anna, who has been a constant source of support and encouragement.

### Website:
Thanks to both the [jekyllrb](https://jekyllrb.com/) static site generator and the [klis√© theme](https://github.com/piharpi/jekyll-klise), which was a major
inspiration for this websites look & feel.
