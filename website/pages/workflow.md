## Reading 

* [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) - I use this to aggregate articles & read. I also take advantage of the "kindle digest" option, which will send unread articles to my kindle devices.

## Information Aggregation

* [Readwise](https://readwise.io/) - I use Readwise to aggreagte highlights from a variety of sources including instapaper, web & kindle. Every day I review a handful of quotes and choose to discard or <3 them.
* [MyMind](https://mymind.com/) - I use MyMind to dump all sorts of things into. Links, memes, movies, books, etc. It isn't perfect, but I haven't found anything better. The dynamic spaces are also really useful, but they don't appear to exist in the mobile version.

## Writing

* [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) - I use Ulysses for more serious writing. Important e-mails, blog posts, essays, etc.
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - I love using markdown editors for simple notes. Currently, I'm using Obsidian. Previously I used Bear.
* [Diarly](https://diarly.app/) - I recently switched to Diarly from DayOne. I opted to use Diarly instead of DayOne because it leverages iCloud storage to house Diaries instead of their own servers.

## Planning/Organizing
* [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - I use this as a general to do app for both home & work.
* [Habitify](https://www.habitify.me/) - For managing habits/routines. The reminders & data tracking are really wonderful.
* [Anylist](https://www.anylist.com/) - I use AnyList for most list creation. Grocery lists, packing lists, moving lists, etc. The collaborative/Shared lists feature is great for managing a grocery list with my wife.
