### Circa 2021-11-08 - 2023-07-20
Below is a snapshot of the About page as of 2021-11-08. This is the first version of the About page that I published.
The photo is a picture from my office at our house in Charlotte. We only lived there for a year before moving back to 
Boise. This was towards the tail-end of covid and I was working from home in a new city, so I had a lot of energy
to put into my home office setup & getting this website up and running.
