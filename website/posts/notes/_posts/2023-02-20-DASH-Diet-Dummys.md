## Dash Nutrient Goal Overview

| **Macronutrient** | **Percentage of Daily Calories** |
| Total Fat | 27 % | 
| Saturated Fat | 6% |
| Protein | 18 % |
| Carbohydrates | 55 % |

| **Nutrient** | **Amount** |
| Cholesterol | 150mg |
| Potassium | 4,700mg |
| Calcium | 1,250 |
| Magnesium | 500mg |
| Fiber | 30 grams | 

## Research
> Most research suggests that an ideal natural blood pressure is around 115/75

### Dash Study Setup
* Randomized controlled trial. 459 men & women who all had high blood pressure (no higher than 160 systolic, 95 diastolic)

1. Everyone given standardized control diet for first 3 weeks, all meals & snacks controlled.
2. After 3 week period, each person randomly assigned to spend 8 weeks on one of the three experimental diets:
    * **Control** (Designed to mimic typical American Diet, high servings of meat low servings of fiber, fruits & vegetables)
    * **Fruits & Vegetables** (received 2.5x fruits & veggie servings as control) Still included same amount of fat & meat as the control diet.
    * **DASH** (Initial study kept sodium at 3,000 mg daily-- high for current DASH)
3. Throughout study blood pressure measured at strict intervals + questionnaire given about symptoms & activity. Urine tests performed to assess potassium, magnesium, calcium & protein levels.

### Results

**Fruits & Vegetables Diet**
* Compared with control diet, Systolic pressure dropped 2.8 pts and diastolic 1.1 pts
* A meaningful reduction in terms of stroke risk.

**DASH Diet**
* DASH dropped systolic by 5.5 pts and diastolic by 3 pts
* In people with hypertension, systolic dropped 11.4 pts & diastolic 5.5 pts-- on par with results expected from medical therapy.

## Basic Dietary Guidelines
General goal is less sodium (1,500 - 2,400 mg daily), less unhealthy fats (saturated fats), more magnesium, potassium, fiber.


### Whole Grains
**Servings (Per Day) :** 6-8
**Example Serving:**  1 slice bread, 1 cup dry cereal, 1/2 cup cooked cereal or rice or pasta.
* Plenty of Fiber
* High in potassium, magnesium & anti-oxidants.
* Supports cardiovascular health
* Dramatic difference between refined & whole grain flour. Once it's refined, most nutrients are stripped away.

### Fruits + Vegetables = Blood Pressure Friendly Nutrients
**Servings (Per Day) :** 4-5
**Example Serving:**  10 grapes, 1 small banana, 1 medium apple, 1 cup raw vegetables, 1/2 cup cooked vegetables.
* high in potassium, fiber, vitamins & anti-oxidants.
* Overlap with whole grain benefits, but the body needs variety.

### Low-Fat Dairy Foods
**Servings (Per Day) :**  2-3
**Example Serving:**  1 Cup Milk or Yogurt, 1 ounce cheese.
* "strongly linked to a lower risk for hypertension because they're rich in vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and potassium; high in protein; and low in saturated fats and calories."
* Evidence that dairy foods may reduce likelihood of stroke (common occurrence with high blood pressure)

### Lean Meats
**Servings (Per Day) :**  2 or fewer
**Example Serving:** 3-4 ounces cooked (per day)
* Fish & Poultry
* Limit exposure to saturated fats

### Nuts, Seeds, Legumes
**Servings (Per Week) :** 4-5
**Example Serving:**  1/3 cup nuts, 2 tablespoons nut butter, 2 tablespoons seeds.
* Heart healthy plant-based protein sources
* High in healthy fats, fiber & magnesium

## Fats & Oils
**Servings (Per Day) :**  3-4
**Example Serving:**  1 teaspoon margarine, butter or oil; 2 tablespoons salad dressing.
* Fats & Oils + Sugary Treats not outright banned by dash, but should be limited
* Portion sizes matter

## Sugary Treats
**Servings (Per Week) :** 5 or fewer
**Example Serving:** 1/2 cup sorbet or frozen yogurt, 1 "fun-size" candy bar, 8 pieces gummy candy, 1 tablespoon jam, 1 ounce dark chocolate (70-85% cocoa)

## Understanding Sodium Claims Per Serving

**Low/no-sodium** - < 5 mg sodium per serving
**Very low sodium** - < 35mg sodium per serving
**Low sodium** < 140 mg sodium per serving


## Ten Lifestyle Changes to Curb Hypertension

1. Lose Weight and Keep It Off
    * Weight loss often #1 treatment for hypertension.
    * Being overweight strains your body and heart
    * Losing weight typically helps improve blood pressure
    * "A healthy diet is not a one-and-done situation." you must maintain lifestyle changes to keep weight off
2. Develop an Exercise Routine
    * Helps keep weight under control
    * Improves cardiovascular health
    * Reduces stress level--which can curb hypertension in the long run.
    * Schedule 20-30 minute walk 5 days a week, add minutes each week. Once you're up to 30/45 minutes walking increase your pace until you can walk a mile in 15 to 20 minutes.
3. Stick to DASH
    * DASH more about what you add versus what you limit (although you should dramatically limit sodium)
    * Fruits & Vegetables very important sources of potassium and magnesium which help lower blood pressure. Fiber helps keep cholesterol in check.
4. Eat less Salt
    * High-salt diet has been shown to raise blood pressure.
    * Daily goal should be between 1,300 and 2,300 mg sodium.
    * 3/4 of all salt in peoples diets comes from prepared foods.
5. Add Good Fats to Your Diet
    * Hypertension is a risk factor for heart disease, as is high cholesterol.
    * Heart healthy fats may improve the balance of good and bad cholesterol in the blood stream.
    * Avoid or limit saturated fats (found in red meat & tropical oils)
    * Seek monounsaturated fat (vegetable oils-- olive, canola, avocado & peanut oils)
    * Nuts, seeds, avacados & olives good to add to diet.
6. Avoid Drinking Alcohol Excessively
    * Overindulging bad for heart & health.
    * If you're a male > 2 drinks daily can lead to heart damage, high blood pressure & high triglycerides. ( > 1 drink for women)
    * 15 or more drinks per week considered heavy drinking for men.
7. Don't Use Tobacco Products
    * Smoking causes corona heart disease, contributes to stroke & increases the risk of peripheral vascular disease.
    * Chewing tobacco raises blood pressure & harms arteries.
    * Tobacco a risk factor for dementia.
8. Stress Less
    * Stress has direct & indirect effects on blood pressure.
    * Stress can impact quality sleep which impacts blood pressure.
    * Regular exercise helps reduce stress as does meditation.
    * Breathing Exercise: Inhale to the count of four; then exhale to the count of 4.
9. Enlist Your Family and Friends
    * Support network can help you keep on track with lifestyle changes.
    * Turn eating well & exercising into a shared and social experience.
    * If your workout buddy misses a day, don't use it as an excuse to slack off.
10. Follow Your Doctor's Orders
    * Follow doctor's advice
    * keep regular appointments
    * Annual physical exam

## Misc

* US average diet includes 3,400mg sodium daily. Human body only requires 500mg sodium daily for normal function.
* Every 20pt rise in systolic or 10pt rise in diastolic blood pressure doubles the risk of heart disease & stroke.
* Losing just 10 lbs can reduce blood pressure by as much as 10pts.

**Extra Weight**
* Estimated that obesity shortens average lifespan 10-20 years.
* Increases risk for:
    * Dementia
    * Arthritis
    * Cancer
    * Diabetes
    * Heart disease
    * Intestinal disease
    * Lung disease
    * Stroke

### Cholesterol
There are both good (HDL) & bad cholesterol (LDL)

**HDL Cholesterol**  (high-density lipoprotein)
* Pulls bad cholesterol out of arteries, takes it back to the liver to be processed & eliminated
* Higher the HDL the better.
* Monounsaturated fats (olive oil, avocados, nuts) and exercise raise HDL.
* Can help protect against heart attack and stroke.

**LDL Cholesterol** (low-density lipoprotein)
* Small amount is required to keep cell membranes healthy, brain working & healthy hormone levels.
*  Clogs arteries
* Most LDL generated in your liver, which can make cholesterol out of lots of food.
* High LDL increases likelihood of heart attack & stroke.
