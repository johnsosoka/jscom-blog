excerpt: The Notes that I keep.
---

Contained here is a collection of various notes. Some are notes that I have taken from udemy courses, book-notes, and 
others may be quick reference notes that I may have scraped together for future use. Anything here is pretty much guaranteed to 
be less coherent than blog posts.
