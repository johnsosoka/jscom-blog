Below is a snippet from my diary, written on the day that Leia passed away. Leia had several health issues, and she had
taken a rapid turn for the worse. My wife Anna and I made the difficult decision to have her put to sleep. Luckily,
we were able to have her put down at home, in the comfort of her own backyard, with her family by her side.

Diary Snippet, 2024-02-27

Leia and I spent a lot of time together today. I helped get her to the back yard, I sat next to her until she wanted back inside.

Leia loved to sit outside in the snow, stoically watching it fall around her. She had a very thick coat and loved cold weather. While Spring has been creeping in these past few days, today was partly cloudy & we got some minor snow flurries. They arrived, conveniently, while we were spending time outside. We sat and let the snow fall around us, just as she had done many times before.

I am thankful we were gifted that moment.

She shut her eyes for the last time around 4:30pm today. Anna and I were petting and comforting her as she passed, the sun came back out for her final hour. Baby Gemma quietly watched us say our goodbyes.

Leia had a good doggie life. We took her all over the place. She’s travelled across the country twice & been on hikes in the mountains. She’s been in the foothills countless times and had many walks in nature along the river. She’s made innumerable friends at the dog park.

Leia was a wonderful companion and cherished member of our household.

Rest in peace Lay-Lay Girl.
