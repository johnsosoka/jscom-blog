excerpt: Public Services I Host
---

I host a few public services for myself, friends, and the public. Below is a list of services that I host. Most 
everything is hosted on AWS & the source code is publicly available on GitHub.

## Miscellaneous Services

Here are the miscellaneous services that don't fit anywhere else.

### My IP

I have a simple what-is-my-ip service that I use to check my public IP address.

**GET** `https://api.johnsosoka.com/v1/ip/my`

Example Response:

```json
{"ip": "24.112.189.216"}
```


## Notion Services

Notion is a great productivity/note-taking tool. I have created a handful of services to augment my use of Notion.
