excerpt: Thoughts on headphones.

I really enjoy a good pair of headphones. I have a pretty good ear for music, but I wouldn't call myself an audiophile. 
At the moment this page is focused on headphones, eventually I'll add a section for DACs and Amps.

## Headphones

The two types of headphones that I have are _Planar Magnetic_ and _Dynamic_. The difference between the two is in how
the sound is produced.

**Planar:** The sound is produced by a flat (like a plane, hence planar) diaphragm that is suspended between two magnets. 

**Dynamic:** A diaphragm is connected to a voice coil within a permanent magnet's field. Electrical current in the coil 
causes movement, producing sound.


### Planar Magnetic

Planar Magnetic headphones are thus far my favorite. I listen to a lot of electronic music, and I find that the bass and 
mids are powerful & clear.


#### HiFiMan Sundara

The Sundara is my favorite pair of headphones in my collection. The bass is so full and clean, no distorting or muddying
of the sound. They're really wonderful for electronica music. I have more expensive pairs, but as a daily driver, these
are my go-to.

#### Ananda BT

The Ananda BT is a bluetooth version of the Ananda. I use these when I'm doing chores around the house, and sometimes at
my desk. I do really adore this pair of headphones, but there's just something about the Sundara that I prefer.

### Dynamic

Dynamic headphones are more common, you've probably used them before.

#### Sennheiser HD 800 S

This is my most expensive pair of headphones. I bought them because I wanted to see what the fuss was about. They have
absolutely incredible sound. This is the pair of headphones that made the concept of "Sound Stage" **very** obvious to me.

While these are phenomenal headphones, I don't use them very often. When listening to lossless music through a good DAC/Amp 
it is simply too much data for my ears. I have to sit with my eyes closed and focus on the music as I'm unable to do anything
else. The HD 800 S is a fine pair of headphones and they particularly excell at acoustic music.
