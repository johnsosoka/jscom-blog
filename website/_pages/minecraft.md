## Server

I'm not currently hosting any public servers, but I may in the future. Keep an eye out here for current world information 
and old world/realm downloads.

* 02/02/2025 - `minecraft.johnsosoka.com` is live again!
  * World backs up nightly at 3am Mountain Time.
  * Currently running on a Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB of RAM.
* ~~04/27/2022 - Realm is live. Contact for invite.~~
* ~~01/10/2022 - minecraft.johnsosoka.com is live!~~

## Downloads

Over the years I have either hosted and/or played on friend hosted minecraft realms & servers. Some worlds have been
lost while others have been backed up. On this page I will do my best to keep world-saves available for download; it
feels wrong to hoard the world backups and not share all the cool creations friends & friends of friends have come up
with.

### World Backups
