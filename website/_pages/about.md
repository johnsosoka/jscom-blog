## Me:

Hi, I'm John. I'm a father, husband, and software engineer living in Boise, I am a backend developer and usually work 
with Java & Python day to day. Over the course of my career I have worked in a variety of roles in software development,
including software tester, release engineer, software engineer, principal software engineer, and tech lead.

Most recently I've been working a lot with Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly Agent design and orchestration. Last
year I wired up a language model to a collection of tools that allowed it to browse the internet and build a themed spotify 
playlists... Once I witnessed the LLM's capacity for planning & tool usage, I was hooked. I have been working on multiple 
LM/Agent related projects ever since.

When I'm not coding, you can find me hiking the trails around Boise with my dogs, hanging out with my family, or 
working on projects around the house. 

I also really enjoy Pinball and have been playing quite a bit at the [Pinball Museum](https://idahopinballmuseum.com/)
in Garden City. I haven't [competed recently](https://www.ifpapinball.com/player.php?p=50104#past), but I do have an IFPA profile :).

I have been on GitHub for a while under a pseudonym, but have recently created a more polished profile which you can 
[visit here](https://github.com/johnsosoka). This same GitHub profile will host code examples to accompany blog posts.

#### Website:

This website is intended to serve as a base of operations for me. I enjoy running this website as somebody might enjoy 
keeping a garden, I like contributing to it and watching it grow but don't have any ambitious plans for it.

As I'm not a professional writer and this is a very low traffic site I might edit or update posts after they are 
published; But, a public record of all changes will be available in the GitHub repository, linked below.

View the source for this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnsosoka/jscom-blog). This includes the Terraform to provision AWS infrastructure for johnsosoka.com as well.

#### Snippets

Below is a short video of a lightning storm filmed in Meridian, Idaho. This was really fun to watch. From 
my location, I couldn't hear any thunder. The lightning was so frequent that I originally thought a work vehicle was
parked outside with its light strobing. When I went to check it out, this is what I saw:
