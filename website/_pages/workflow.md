## Reading 

* [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) - I use this to aggregate articles & read. I also take advantage of the "kindle digest" option, which will send unread articles to my kindle devices.

## Information Aggregation

* [MyMind](https://mymind.com/) - I use MyMind to dump all sorts of things into. Links, memes, movies, books, etc. It isn't perfect, but I haven't found anything better. The dynamic spaces are also really useful, but they don't appear to exist in the mobile version **[Edit 2023-07-23: Spaces feature now exists in mobile]**.
* ~~[Readwise](https://readwise.io/) - I use Readwise to aggreagte highlights from a variety of sources including instapaper, web & kindle. Every day I review a handful of quotes and choose to discard or <3 them.~~

## Writing

* [Ulysses](https://ulysses.app/) - I use Ulysses for more serious writing. Important e-mails, blog posts, essays, etc.
* [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) - I love using markdown editors for simple notes. Currently, I'm using Obsidian. Previously I used Bear.
* [Diarly](https://diarly.app/) - I recently switched to Diarly from DayOne. I opted to use Diarly instead of DayOne because it leverages iCloud storage to house Diaries instead of their own servers.

## Planning/Organizing
* [Habitify](https://www.habitify.me/) - For managing habits/routines. The reminders & data tracking are really wonderful.
* [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) - I use Notion for tracking projects, as a personal wiki, and for [managing home storage](/note/2023/12/28/qr-code-box-organization.html). I'm several years deep into using it for managing home storage and with their AI feature, I can simply ask "where is my collection of audio converters" and it will show me the box location. 
The hard part is keeping the digital entry updated, but it's well worth the effort.
* ~~[Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) - I use this as a general to do app for both home & work.~~
* ~~[Anylist](https://www.anylist.com/) - I use AnyList for most list creation. Grocery lists, packing lists, moving lists, etc. The collaborative/shared lists feature is great for managing a grocery list with my wife.~~
