ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome to my personal homepage. I'm mostly using it as a place to practice writing, share family updates, 
document projects, and collect my thoughts.

Most of the technical content is in the [blog](/blog) section. The [bytes](/notes) section is more of a wildcard, but it's 
where I'll share book notes, course notes, quick tips, passing thoughts, etc.

The [beyond](/beyond) page serves as an index for some of the other miscellaneous pages.

The source code for this website is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnsosoka/jscom-blog).
