ðŸ‘‹ Hello and welcome to my homepage. It's a little chaotic, but it's mine ðŸ™‚. I'm mostly using it as a place to share
family updates, document my projects, collect my thoughts and practice writing.

Most of the technical content is in the [blog](/blog) section. The [notes](/notes) section is a bit of a mess--it contains 
book notes, Udemy course notes and probably a few barely coherent notes with bits of information I've picked up along 
the way.

There are other pages such as [books](/books), where I'll share _some_ books that I recommend and [bits](/bits), my little 
microblog experiment. The [etc](/etc) page serves as an index for some of the other miscellaneous pages.

Feel free to check out the source code for this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/johnsosoka/jscom-blog).
