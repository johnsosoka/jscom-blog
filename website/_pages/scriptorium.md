A place to store some scripts that I've written. Active & Retired


# Active

## kill-jekyll.sh
Simple script to kill a runaway jekyll process (or whatever is bound to port 4000)

## cleanup-files.sh
I have this script execute once a month via crontab. It just cleans up my desktop & downloads folder. 
I'm a bit of a digital hoarder, so this helps me keep things tidy.

# Retired

## deploy.sh
The old deploy script for this very website. I've since moved to deploying via github actions.
