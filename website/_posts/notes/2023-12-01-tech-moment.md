I'm reading [Symphony of Thought](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/daveshap/SymphonyOfThought/main/Symphony%20of%20Thought%20v3.pdf)
by David Shapiro this morning. He has been experimenting with building thinking machines.

I have been having SO MUCH FUN these past few months building thinking machines. Working through how they can be logically organized, 
how to enhance them with memory or split up responsibility between multiple semi-autonomous agents.

A few weeks ago I had an agent generating tasks for another agent to execute on--that was so much fun to watch in action.

It is really a fun time to be working in this space. 

I just wanted to take a moment and appreciate it. The technology is advancing so rapidly that it's unlikely
that this sort of work will be as fun, intriguing or necessary in a couple of years.
