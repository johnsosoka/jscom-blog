**What is a recursive acronym?**

A recursive acronym is an acronym that refers to itself. Techopedia defines a recursive acronym as follows:

> A recursive acronym embeds a copy of itself within the acronym. One of the best known examples is Richard Stallman's GNU 
> project. GNU stands for "GNU's Not Unix." That copy in turn contains the word GNU, so the acronym is infinitely recursive. 
> In GNU's case, the acronym is a play on words: GNU is not Unix in the sense that it does not have any code dating to the 
> original Bell Labs Unix, but the behavior of GNU attempts to mimic Unix systems as closely as possible.

Recursive acronyms are also sometimes referred to as "self-referential acronyms," the two have the same meaning. A few other
popular recursive acronyms include `pip` which stands for "pip installs packages" and `cURL` which stands for "Curl URL 
Request Library"

Writing a recursive acronym is a rite of passage for some and a trivial (or possible asinine)  pursuit for others.



## Tip No. 1 - Start at the End

Start at the finish line--that sounds easy enough, right? The truth is, it's pretty difficult to have an acronym reference
itself if the acronym doesn't already exist. If you don't already have an acronym in mind, you still have some choies
available.

Note these common recursive acronym structures (these aren't rules, just common patterns SPARKS breaks this pattern and
is tail recursive.)

| Start | Middle | End |
|-------|--------|-----|
| References itself | State (it is or isn't something) | What is isn't or is |
| References itself | Action | What it does |

If you know what the subject of your recursive acronym does or is, then you can work backwards in assembling your
recursive acronym. For example, if your subject is a library or a framework, you can try generating some acronyms
with `L` or `F` as the final characters. 

## Tip No. 2 - The Middle is for State or Action

Review the following selection of popular recursive acronyms...notice a pattern?

Acronym | Stands For | Has Is?	| Hidden is? |
--------|------------|----------|-----------|
cUrl | Curl URL Request Library | no | no |
EINE | EINE Is Not Emacs | yes | no |
FIJI | FIJI is Just ImageJ | yes | no |
GNU	 | Gnu's Not Unix | yes | yes |
MINT | MINT Is Not TRAC | yes | no |
Nano | Nano's Another Editor | yes | yes |
LAME | LAME Ain't an MP3 Encoder | no | no |
PIP	| PIP Installs Packages	| no | no |
WINE | Wine Is Not an Emulator | yes | no |
YAML | YAML Aint Markup Language | no | no | 

A whopping 60% of them have the state `is` in one fashion or another. It's incredibly popular to state what your recursive 
acronym either **is** (Nano, Fiji,) or **is not** (gnu, wine, MINT, EINE). Interestingly enough, it  is popular to say 
what the acronym isn't, even while avoiding "is not" like YAML and LAME both saying what _they aint._

With this in mind, if you know what your recursive acronym isn't--then consider `I`, `IN`, or `A` for your middle initials.
If you already have the middle characters reserved, then don't be afraid to use a contraction to sneak `is` into your definition
like in the example with both gnu & nano.
