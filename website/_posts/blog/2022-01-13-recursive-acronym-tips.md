**What is a recursive acronym?**

A recursive acronym is an acronym that refers to itself. Technopedia defines a recursive
acronym as follows:

> A recursive acronym embeds a copy of itself within the acronym. One of the best known examples is Richard Stallman's GNU 
> project. GNU stands for "GNU's Not Unix." That copy in turn contains the word GNU, so the acronym is infinitely recursive. 
> In GNU's case, the acronym is a play on words: GNU is not Unix in the sense that it does not have any code dating to the 
> original Bell Labs Unix, but the behavior of GNU attempts to mimic Unix systems as closely as possible.

Recursive acronyms are also sometimes referred to as "self-referential acronyms," the two have the same meaning. A few other
popular recursive acronyms include `pip` which stands for "pip installs packages" and `cURL` which stands for "Curl URL 
Request Library"
