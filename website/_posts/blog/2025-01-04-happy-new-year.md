ðŸŽ‰ Happy New Year!

2024 was a big year for AI, Agents, and me. I'm excited to see what 2025 has in store. I started experimenting with LLMs
via OpenAI in late 2022, and built my first LLM application around mid 2023. Around the start of 2024, I had the wonderful
privilege and opportunity to focus on AI/LLM Development full-time with [Commerce Architects](https://www.commerce-architects.com/).

This past year, building Agents & Multi-Actor systems really began to take off across the industry. While I cannot share 
details on my personal blog, we have shipped some really cool Agent-based applications to production for a handful of 
clients. Our labs team produced an AI Agent that interfaces with the [commercetools](https://commercetools.com) platform 
that was named "Accelerator of the Week" by commercetools. I'm really proud of the work we've done and the team we've built.

I've been trying to share more knowledge as I acquire it. From a [LangChain4J introduction](https://www.commerce-architects.com/post/the-basic-building-blocks-of-agents) 
to a Python LangGraph [LLM-based query/model router](https://github.com/johnsosoka/langgraph-model-router), I created an
[example implementation](https://johnsosoka.com/blog/2024/02/10/implement-self-discover.html) of the DeepMind SELF-DISCOVER
algorithm.

I'm looking forward to learning & sharing more in 2025. I think that we are on the cusp of a knowledge revolution, and this 
year will yield some fascinating new software patterns & breakthroughs around AI & Agent design/orchestration.

Here's to fun and interesting 2025!
