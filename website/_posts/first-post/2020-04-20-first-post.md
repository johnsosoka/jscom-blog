I'll be brief as this post really only exists to mark the occasion of getting this up and running. Finding [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) really 
simplified my plan for setting up a homepage with the domain I bought and _mayyyybe_ trying to blog. Initially, I was going to be self hosting ghost
and mysql, setting up a new vpc on aws, blah blah blah--but now I can just blog in markdown, "compile" static sites & deploy to s3 (on the cheap) as static 
site.
