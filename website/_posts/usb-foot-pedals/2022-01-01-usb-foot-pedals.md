What started off as a quest to alleviate arm strain has now developed into a new way of interfacing with my computer.

Near the top of the pandemic I was playing an unreal amount of the pc game counter strike, which results in many repetitive 
motions and _lots_ of clicking--this eventually resulted in tennis elbow. In my case, it could be called (embarrassingly) 
be called computer elbow but both describe the same condition, lateral epicondylitis.

Initially, time off & bracing helped alleviate some pain from the injury...but this injury was going to take more time 
to heal than I was capable of breaking from the computer. This set me on my quest to find alternatives.

I started off only interested in a substitute for left/right click, but soon realized a few other common operations could
be attached to these pedals. I currently have 5 pedals, below is a picture with each role labeled.

I use the Play/Pause media controls regularly enough to warrant a foot pedal. The scroll down / Scroll down pedals are
bound to down arrow / up arrow; These pedal bindings are enormously helpful when reading, browsing & scrolling through
most web content. The left/right click pedals do just that--Keep in mind I still click with the mouse, I just use these
as an alternative for when my injury is flaring up.

The triggers for these can be adjusted fairly easily. As I continue using the computer with foot pedals, I am coming up
with new configurations. For example, when I play minecraft I change `scroll down` to `w` to walk forward & `scroll up`
to `d` to walk backwards.

There are many other applications for these foot pedals beyond gaming. If I was spending more time in the command line,
I would probably set up one of the pedals to act as a vim clutch to toggle between insert & normal mode.

That pretty much concludes my post, I spoke to handful of friends about using usb foot pedals in this way and 90% of them
didn't realize that foot pedals could be utilized outside of gaming or transcription. As such, I wanted to drop a 
quick post highlighting the potential of usb foot pedals to get the word out. 

I think that there might be some great
potential for combining pedal usage with AutoHotKey scripts in the future--I have some notes on writing ahk scripts
[here ](/notes/cookbook/ahk-recipe-examples/2021-12-27-ahk-recipes-example-howto/).

Happy new year!
