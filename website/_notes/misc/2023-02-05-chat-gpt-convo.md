A few weeks ago I had my first conversation with chatGPT. I gave it increasingly challening programming questions. Here
are the screenshots:

# Python

## Write a Python function that calculates the Fibonacci sequence to the Nth Degree.

## Write a Python functiona that determines a users age when given their birth year.

## Write a Python function that will give the current temperature in fahrenheit for a given zip code.

In this question, I was seeing if chatGPT could import and utilize an api client to solve a task.

# Java

## Write a Java method to convert arabic numbers to roman numerals.

## Write a "Hello World" SpringBoot application.

Can chatGPT use SpringBoot?

It even provides a pom, which is truncated in the screenshot.

## Given a model object with a name and age field, write a java method which uses spring data JPA to persist it to a database.
